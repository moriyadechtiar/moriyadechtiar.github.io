                                    <br> FIFA presented historical information per national team based on their participation
                                    and performance in previous soccer tournaments.
                                    <br> We have chosen to focus on number of participations and number of times reached one
                                    of the top 4 places.
                                    <br> This data was acquired for previous World Cups, Confederation Cups and previous Summer
                                    Olympics.

                                    the countries that will qualify for the World Cup.
                                    <br> We have collected for each game, the date, time, countries, goals for and against, the
