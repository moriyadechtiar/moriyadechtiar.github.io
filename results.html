                <p>A total of 20 single models were created for the purpose of predicting results in the 2018 World Cup. Baseline
                    model was showing a R^2 results that is negative. We then went and optimized based on cross validation,
                    feature selection and ensembling models.
                </p>

                <p>While some models reached almost perfect scores on the training set, those patterns were not easily generalized
                    to apply on the test datasets and therefore the test scores are much lower. Most of the models showed
                    similar accuracy scores for train and test set (knn, regressions etc) which can be explained by the fact
                    that the relationship is a lot more complex than what these models were able to capture.
                </p>

                <p>High dimensionality was a major risk as we had about 130 different predictors. Attempts to select a subset
                    of these features showed success in some cases, but the best performing models made use in the entire
                    set of features.</p>

                <p>The following table summarizes the results achieved by each of the models on both the train set and the test
                    set. This is for prediction the expected points and the W/L/D classes.</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/results1.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>For predicting goal difference:</p>

                    <img src="img/results2.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b>Final Prediction:</b>
                </p>
                <p>While our model did not do a great job in the accuracy of predicting the actual points each team will get,
                    it did reasonably well in predicting the top teams.</p>

                <p>Group Phase: 11/16 teams predicted.</p>
                <p>It appears teams such as Egypt, Senegal Poland and Saudi Arabia were able to get higher classes somehow.</p>
                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/group_phase.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>Knockout Phase: 0.87% accuracy.</p>
                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/knokout_phase.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>One explanation to why we did so much better in predicting results in the knockout phase compared to the
                    group phase is the elimination of a draw result. In our analysis it seemed that predicting Draw was a
                    lot more difficult for our models than predicting a win or loss.
                    <br>Draw games turned out to be difficult observations for our model to classify.
                    <br>Despite this, if we used this model to try and predict the champion of the 2018 World Cup - we would
                    have had a success.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Next Steps:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More investigation on feature selection can be valuable for next models. </li>

                    <li>Adding difference type predictors instead of actual values could also help our model (i.e. difference
                        in fifa rank instead of 2 columns for each teamâ€™s fifa rank)</li>

                    <li>Considering only games history from official preliminary games and not from friendlies. </li>

                    <li>Creating 2 step classification dealing with for closely ranked teams. </li>

                    <li>Domain knowledge matters - both partners creating this project are very light - soccer fans and have
                        little understanding of the complexity of factors impacting soccer games results. This was challenging
                        at times but a very interesting learning curve that was shaped only by the results we obtained throughout
                        the work on this project. </li>
