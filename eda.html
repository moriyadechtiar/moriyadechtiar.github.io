                <h3>FIFA Rank Validity</h3>
                <p>
                    Could the winner of the World Cup games be simply the number one ranking team by FIFA ranking?
                    <br>The answer is already known - No. Germany (#1) was in fact dropped at a relatively early stage, much
                    earlier that expected.
                    <br>So is the FIFA ranking valid for predicting results?
                </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/dist_outcome.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/match_outcome_fifa_rank1.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/match_outcome_fifa_rank2.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>We expected to see more wins in the higher ranking teams but it actually look as if we have more losses and
                    draws. One explanation could be that the higher ranking teams usually play with other higher ranking
                    teams and so it is more difficult to win a game. Could be that if the rank difference is high, this is
                    a better indicator.</p>

                <h3>Players Contribution</h3>
                <p>Players make up the team and maybe the better chances to win belong to the team with the better performing
                    players. We examined several different skills categories and also the FIFA rank per players.</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/player_contribution1.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/player_contribution2.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/player_contribution3.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/player_contribution4.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>Age is showing to have some relation with success as we can see more wins for younger players teams. Amongst
                    the skills categories we can see that defence skills and Physical skills both show the most promise for
                    winning.
                </p>

                <h3>Players Per Capita</h3>
                <p>It is argued that countries exporting talent to foreign leagues tend to do better at world cups. This world
                    cup where Croatia was surprisingly successful, we decided to add this feature inspired by this article:
                    <a href="https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-worlds-biggest-exporter-of-footballers-per-capita/">https://www.croatiaweek.com/croatia-worlds-biggest-exporter-of-footballers-per-capita/</a>
                </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/capita.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <h3>Team Historical Performance</h3>
                <p>We have collected information about teams performance in the last 3 years following the world cup for preliminaries,
                    friendlies and olympic games. We expect to see the better performing teams to do better in the world
                    cup.
                </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/historic_performance1.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/historic_performance2.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>The above scatter plots show that unfortunately the boundaries are very hard to define, it appears games
                    won and lost are completely mixed based on the history features. It also appears that using previous
                    world cup or olympics statistics will not help help much and this can be explained by the fact that for
                    the great majority of countries all those features are 0.
                </p>

                <h3>Protective Teams</h3>
                <p>Being protective can help a team win more. 2 thirds of the wins are achieved by protective teams.</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/protective.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <h3>Aggressive Teams</h3>
                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/aggresive.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>Being aggressive can be counterproductive, 75% of losses suffered by aggressive teams.</p>

                <h3>Homeness Factor</h3>
                <div class="col-12">
                    <img src="img/homeness.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>For home games we have half as many losses as we do wins. In the neutral 0 homeness group, the win-loss ratio
                    is much closer. Note - we have more examples for home games in our dataset.</p>
